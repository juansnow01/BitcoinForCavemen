# Bitcoin For Cavemen
I (BTC novice) providing all the links and info I can muster, that have helped me in my BTC education of a resounding 1 year, to help you understand.

You're here because you both, keep hearing about Bitcoin and know nothing about Bitcoin. That is where I come in, I'm not here as an expert but more like a librarian. I'll provide what I can but for whatever is outside my wheelhouse I will be able to find you links to do further research on. 

Bitcoin is best described as electronic cash. Some see it as digital gold, digital real estate, the list goes on. But, lets start with the who/what/when/why/how...

** I will be using Bitcoin and BTC interchangeably 
*** If you see something incorrect LET ME KNOW!

## Who:

#### "Who created Bitcoin?"

Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, whether they were man/woman or one person/team is all a mystery because they never revealed their identity and soon after Bitcoins release they vanished, like the avatar. Many theories get thrown around as to who they were, where they were from and how many of them there were. My favorite theory was the one where they called Satoshi a time traveller. But we'll probably never know who Satoshi is, maybe that's a good thing. 

#### "Who controls Bitcoin?"

No one does, that is what makes it so revolutionary. [BitcoinQnA](https://twitter.com/bitcoinq_a) details is perfectly on his [website](https://bitcoiner.guide/qna/common/) "Put simply, everyone and no-one. Everyone is in control of their own participation in the network and the network is structured so that bad actors cannot succeed. No single developer can incite any changes to the code. No one miner can censor specific transactions. No single user can cheat the system and spend Bitcoin they donâ€™t have or that does not belong to them.
"

Decentralization is what adds to Bitcoins allure, no government/army/business can get it shut down... youd essentially have to shut down the internet, but even then people are finding ways to transact via radio waves and other ways. 

## What:

#### "What gives it value?"

Bitcoins value comes from more than just one thing, its biggest selling point is its scarcity, there are 21 Million BTC. Just like land, no more is getting made. In my opinion, its more than just its scarcity, scarcity helps with its price action though. Bitcoin being permisionless is what gives it value beyond the price, anyone with a phone/computer can access this open monetary network. Just download a wallet and BOOM.

#### "What can I buy with BTC?"

You can buy anything with BTC, as long as someone is willing to accept it. It's money, as long as they have a wallet. This is what BTC is about, peer to peer transactions, without the need trusted 3rd parties that take their sneaky 3% off the top (looking at you Visa)

#### "What is a Blockchain?"

Blockchain is essentally a slow database, its slow and inefficient but it fkeeps the network honest. Each block is mined every 10 mins by miners worldwide solving complex math problems, each block contains every transaction made within that timeframe and is then linked with all other transaction before it, creating a chain. If you want you transaction is the next block you just gotta make sure you pay a higher fee than the next person. Transactions can not be walked back meaning that any bad actors will need to spend ALOT of money wasting a lot of electricy to insert their block and manioulate all the other blocks coming after to catch up to the chain. This makes it very expensive to try and trick the network, basically forcing everyone to play nice. 

## When:

#### "When was Bitcoin invented?"

Bitcoin was invented in the late 2000's shortly after the '08 recession, but that's not when this idea of digital cash started. There were many projects that collectively led to BTC's creation. Projects like Hashcash, BitGold etc referenced in this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/were-there-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin/) details some of the projects that preceeded Bitcoin. 

#### "When should I start buying?"

Now... No seriously, most people learn by jumping right in, buy $40 worth and move it to a wallet and see how it works for yourself. Do your own research first and at first only buy what you are willing to part with if you mess up. 

The best time to buy Bitcoin was in 2009, the second best time is today. 

## Where:

#### "Where can I buy Bitcoin?"

This is gonna ruffle some feathers, but depending on where you are based, you can get it at a BTC ATM, BTC meet ups, Cashapp, apps liek Strike make it simple to buy (even though you have to provide ID info). In recent years, many exchanges started sprouting like weeds, selling BTC, essentially turning to the biggest game in town, they make it so seamless, but theres a drawback including high fees for withdrawl (FUCK BINANCE) and high barriers for entry (coinbase) and all of them include submitting some form of photo ID and bank info. 

If you want some more privacy, Id say you sell some goods and services and just accept BTC as payment. Or nime it at home, thats a conversation for another time, I'm just tryong to explain the very basics here. 

## Why:

#### "Why do we need Bitcoin?"

Different folks have different reasons, the best reason for Bitcoin's "why?" is best explained by many folks smarter than myself, my favorite though is an article by [Parman](https://twitter.com/parman_the?lang=en) in this [article](https://armantheparman.com/why-bitcoin/). But to put it in my own words, it's many things mainly it being out of the reach of a central authority like a govt or bank, people with agendas. No one person or group can control BTC, and unlike many other digital tokens that operate on Proof of Stake (as opposed to BTCs Proof of Work) the more BTC you own doesnt give you any more power over the network than the next person. 

Every economical disaster in the history of money has been caused by the people closest to the money printer going crazy to line their own pockets. With BTC, no one has the power to do that. So it's safe to assume that adopting BTC would help keep fuck ups like that happening. Every day that goes by, your USD/CAD/GBP/EUR/AUD is worth less and less because of these clowns, dont leave that in their hands anymore.
