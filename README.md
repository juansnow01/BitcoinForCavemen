# Bitcoin For Cavemen
I (BTC novice) providing all the links and info I can muster, that have helped me in my BTC education of a resounding 1 year, to help you understand.

You're here because you both, keep hearing about Bitcoin and know nothing about Bitcoin. That is where I come in, I'm not here as an expert but more like a librarian. I'll provide what I can but for whatever is outside my wheelhouse I will be able to find you links to do further research on.
